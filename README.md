  # Medical-Diagnosis-with-CNN-Transfer-Learning
With the help of CNN and Transfer Learning we will diagnosis the Pneumonia cancer from X_ray images

### AI for Medical Diagnosis
Computer Vision (CV) has a lot of applications in medical diagnosis:

# Dermatology
# Ophthakmology
# Histopathology.
X-rays images are critical for the detection of lung cancer, pneumenia ... In this notebook you will learn:

Data pre-processing
Preprocess images properly for the train, validation and test sets.
Set-up a pre-trained neural network to make disease predictions on chest X-rays.
In this notebook you will work with chest X-ray images taken from the public ChestX-ray8 dataset.

# What is Pneumonia ?
From Mayo Clinic's Article on pneumonia

Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. The air sacs may fill with fluid or pus (purulent material), causing cough with phlegm or pus, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing. A variety of organisms, including bacteria, viruses and fungi, can cause pneumonia.

Pneumonia can range in seriousness from mild to life-threatening. It is most serious for infants and young children, people older than age 65, and people with health problems or weakened immune systems.

# Computer Vision
Computer vision is an interdisciplinary scientific field that deals with how computers can gain a high-level understanding from digital images or videos. From the perspective of engineering, it seeks to understand and automate tasks that the human visual system can do. We can use Computer Vision to determine whether a person is affected by pneumonia or not.
